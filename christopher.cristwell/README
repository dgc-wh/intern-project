I want you to build me a (very simple) web application for handling short orders at a restaurant. It should consist of (at least) two pages:

1. (waiter's page) A page for submitting an order. This should include a selection box or a list of check boxes that the user can select/check to enumerate the items in the order. There should be at least five items, be creative. There should be a submit button that sends the order back to the server and refreshes so the page is ready for the next order.

2. (cook's page) A page that enumerates the current orders. A simple table should suffice. There should be a button next to each order which lets the user delete the order from the list.

You may use any language you wish, but I'll recommend either perl or javascript. If you use javascript you'll want to use "node.js" (http://nodejs.org/) as your backend/server.

Bonus points if you make the pages render well on smart-phone sized screens.

Extra bonus points if you read up on ReST (Representational State Transfer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer ) and model your application on those principles (we're a ReST shop).

To submit your project make an account on github (https://github.com/), make a fork off of my intern-projects repo (https://github.com/dgc-wh/intern-project) commit your stuff, and submit a pull request back to my repo.
